## Notes
- Copeland Deletion Algorithm.
- Preference profile generator uses swaps to implement randomness. This paper shows that it will take n*log(n) swaps to get a truly random distribution.

- Added diversity mixin to model.
- abs_diversity mixin doesn't give complete solution set.
## Tasks
- [x] Add mixin to copeland runner.
- [ ] Create appropriate model data for the test. (6-7 agents?)
- [ ] Add the mixins to the runner.
- [ ] Try deletion with the different mixins.
- [ ] Create deletion plots of each mixin.

- Focus on the computational budget.
