# Meeting 13

## Things to Discuss
- [x] Student to project matching problem
    - [x] n students to 1 project.
- [.] Restructure the code.
- [ ] Travel planning problem -- maybe
- [x] Go through the set of minzinc problem implementation.
- CPAIOR:
    Short Paper(at most 8 pages w/o references):
        Abstracts:  November 29, 2021 (anywhere on Earth: AoE)
        Full papers: December 3, 2021 (AoE)
    Extended Abstract:
        Abstract: March 3, 2022 (AoE)
    Main problem: Extend social choice into constraint optimisation
        - demonstrate how this could work in local search.
        - demonstrate the key ideas experimentally.
        - what is cp, how does social choice work and how we can connect them.
    Timeline
        - Proofreadable version by 29th November.
        - Metrics:
            how close to the true copeland winner are we?
            do we get a reasonably good copeland winner with a subset of solutions?
            and look into the most 'useful' parameters.
            3-4 models
                project assignment
                photo(?) -- weighted friends & enimeies(?)
                travel planning & network

    Combination of diversity search & deletion rate leads to better results.

## Notes for next meeting
- [ ] Run all the experiments.
