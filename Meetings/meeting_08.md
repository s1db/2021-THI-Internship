## Notes
- Candidates when uniformly distributed have a skewed distribution of copeland score frequencies.
- The frequency of copeland score is dependent on the step size and deletion ratio.
- Resources for weighted tournaments.
    - In the handbook of of social choice.
    - look into top cycles.
    - eigen value decompositoin of the agacency matrix, page 86 weighted tournaments.
    - kengall-wei scores. 
- Small combinatorial problems if we can find small but useful
    - photo assignment.
    - define the problem as a minizinc problem.
    - familiarise yourself to the model.
    - play around with small instances. (5)
## Tasks
- TUE:
    - [ ] Try implementing the photo assignment problem purely in MiniZinc.
    - [ ] Try implementing the photo assignment problem in Python+MiniZinc.
    - [ ] Read up on weighted tournaments.
