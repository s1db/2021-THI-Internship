# Meeting 04

_Meeting will take place on 15th July 2021, at 14:30 IST._

## Points of discussion
- The present state of the Iterative Copeland script.
- Shift from voting to objective functions.
    - How does that affect bias?
    - chapter 10 of comsoc.
- Deleting candidates.
    - Is it helpful?
    - Are there any demerits?
- Where would iterative copeland be useful?
    - Works well in bipolar preference profiles.
    - How would it compete with a system that's drastically skewed/biased?
- More ideas for voter classes -- equivalence classes of solutions template i.e A B C D, .
    - Bipolar distribution.
    - Median voter theorem.
    - A distribution.(i.e 60:40)
## Next steps
- [x] Write unit tests for current code.
- [x] Voter template classes
    - [x] Add parametrized randomness to the solution rankings. - Write a 'noise' function.
    - [x] Clean the code.
    - [x] Bipolar distribution.
    - [x] Median voter theorem.
    - [x] Take distributions as inputs.
